    "\n",

    "DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a principle of software development. The focus of\n",
    "\n",
    "DRY is to avoid repetition of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write code that performs the same tasks over and over again, any\n",
    "\n",
    "modification of one task requires the same change to be made to every single\n",
    "\n",
    "instance of that task! Editing every instance of a task is a lot of work.\n",

    "Instead, we can create **functions** that perform those tasks, using sets of\n",
    "\n",
    "**arguments** or inputs to specify how the task is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The benefits of functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modularity:** If you write function for specific individual tasks, you can use them over and over. A function that you write for one script can even be reused in other scripts!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fewer global variables:** When you run a function, the intermediate variables that it creates are not stored in your global environment. This saves memory and keeps your global environment cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Better documentation:** Well documented functions help the user understand the steps of your processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Easier to maintain / edit:** When you create a function for a repeated task, it is easy to edit that one function. Then every location in your code where that same task is performed is automatically updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Testing:** We don't discuss this in our class this week, but writing functions allows you to more easily test your code to identify bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good functions only do one thing, but they do it well and often in a variety of contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the operations contained in a good function are generally useful for many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance the R function `mean()`, which computes sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function only does one thing (computes a mean), but it can do it very well in many different circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is highly **modular** in the sense that it can be easily combined with other functions to accomplish a variety of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write **modular** functions, you can even re-use them for other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people even write their own R packages for personal use that contain custom functions for their work!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fewer global variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Global variables are objects in R that exist within the **global environment**, which you can think of as a storage container for all of the objects in your R session.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you code line by line, you end up creating numerous intermediate variables\n",
    "\n",
    "that you don't need to use again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is suboptimal for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Global variables accumulate in your environment, but you may never need to access intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Global variables consume memory, which can lead to reduced performance. In the extreme, you may run out of RAM if you have too many objects in your global environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Having many global variables increases the odds that you will define another global variable with the same name by chance, inadvertently overwriting existing objects and leading to a variety of problems, some of which can be difficult to diagnose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are useful in part because they have their own environments which are created when the function is called, and destroyed (by default) once the function returns it result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects defined inside of functions are thus created inside of that function's environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the function is done running, those objects do not persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to minimizing the number of objects in your global environment, defining objects within functions is good because those objects will not overwrite previously existing objects in the global environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
