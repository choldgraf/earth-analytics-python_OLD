    "\n",
    "A waveform or distribution of light energy is what returns to the LiDAR sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this return may be recorded in two different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **Discrete Return LiDAR System** records individual (discrete) points for\n",
    "\n",
    "the peaks in the waveform curve. Discrete return LiDAR systems, identify peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "and record a point at each peak location in the waveform curve. These discrete\n",
    "\n",
    "or individual points are called returns. A discrete system may record 1-4 (and\n",
    "\n",
    "sometimes more) returns from each laser pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A **Full Waveform LiDAR System** records a distribution of returned light\n",
    "\n",
    "energy. Full waveform LiDAR data are thus more complex to process however they\n",
    "\n",
    "can often capture more information compared to discrete return LiDAR systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## LiDAR File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it is collected as discrete points or full waveform, most often LiDAR\n",
    "\n",
    "data are available as discrete points. A collection of discrete return LiDAR\n",
    "\n",
    "points is known as a LiDAR point cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The commonly used file format to store LIDAR point cloud data is called .las\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a format supported by the Americal Society of Photogrammetry and Remote\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensing (ASPRS). Recently, the [.laz](http://www.laszip.org/) format has been\n",
    "\n",
    "developed by Martin Isenberg of LasTools. The differences is that .laz is a\n",

    "highly compressed version of .las.\n",

    "### LiDAR Data Attributes: X,Y, Z, Intensity and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "LiDAR data attributes can vary, depending upon how the data were collected and\n",
    "\n",
    "processed. You can determine what attributes are available for each lidar point\n",
    "\n",
    "by looking at the metadata. All lidar data points will have an associated X,Y\n",
    "\n",
    "location and Z (elevation values). Most lidar data points will have an intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "value, representing the amount of light energy recorded by the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some LiDAR data will also be \"classified\" -- not top secret. Classification refers\n",
    "\n",
    "to tagging each point with the object that it reflected off of. So if a pulse reflects\n",
    "\n",
    "off of a tree branch, we would assign it to the class \"vegetation\". If the pulse\n",
    "\n",
    "reflects off of the ground, we would assign it to the class \"ground\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification of LiDAR point clouds is an additional\n",
    "\n",
    "processing step. Classification simply represents the type of object that the\n",
    "\n",
    "laser return reflected off of. So if the light energy reflected off of a tree,\n",
