    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a data product?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A data product, is the data that are DERIVED from an instrument, or information\n",
    "\n",
    "collected on the ground. For instance, you may go out in the field and measure\n",
    "\n",
    "the heights of trees at 20 plots. Then calculate an average height per plot.\n",

    "### How a lidar system records points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that lidar is an active remote sensing system that records reflected\n",
    "\n",
    "or returned light energy. A discrete return lidar system, records the strongest\n",
    "\n",
    "reflections of light as discrete or individual points. Each point has an associated\n",
    "\n",
    "X, Y and Z value associated with it.  It also has an intensity which represents\n",
    "\n",
    "the amount of energy that returned to the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "\n",
    "## Discrete vs. Full Waveform LiDAR\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember the difference betweeen discrete return and full waveform lidar.\n",
    "\n",
    "A waveform or distribution of light energy is what returns to the LiDAR sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this return may be recorded in two different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **Discrete Return LiDAR System** records individual (discrete) points for\n",
    "\n",
    "the peaks in the waveform curve. Discrete return LiDAR systems, identify peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "and record a point at each peak location in the waveform curve. These discrete\n",
    "\n",
    "or individual points are called returns. A discrete system may record 1-4 (and\n",
    "\n",
    "sometimes more) returns from each laser pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A **Full Waveform LiDAR System** records a distribution of returned light\n",
    "\n",
    "energy. Full waveform LiDAR data are thus more complex to process however they\n",
    "\n",
    "can often capture more information compared to discrete return LiDAR systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LiDAR Data Attributes: X,Y, Z, Intensity and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of discrete return LiDAR points is known as a LiDAR point cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "LiDAR data attributes can vary, depending upon how the data were collected and\n",
    "\n",
    "processed. You can determine what attributes are available for each lidar point\n",
    "\n",
    "by looking at the metadata. All lidar data points will have an associated X,Y\n",
    "\n",
    "location and Z (elevation values). Most lidar data points will also have an **intensity**\n",
    "\n",
    "value, representing the amount of light energy recorded by the sensor.\n",

    "### Classified Lidar Points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some LiDAR data will also be \"classified\". Classification refers\n",
    "\n",
    "to tagging each point with the object that it reflected off of. So if a pulse reflects\n",
    "\n",
    "off of a tree branch, we would assign it to the class \"vegetation\". If the pulse\n",

    "\n",
    "it might be classified as \"vegetation\". And if it reflected off of the ground,\n",
    "\n",
    "it might be classified as \"ground\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some LiDAR products will be classified as \"ground/non-ground\". Some datasets\n",

    "> Plasio is a project by Uday Verma and Howard Butler that implements point cloud rendering capability in a browser.
