    "## Creating A Raster From LiDAR Point Clouds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to create a raster from LiDAR point clouds. Let's look\n",
    "\n",
    "at one of the most basic ways to create a raster file points - gridding.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you grid raster data, you calculate a value for each pixel or cell in your\n",
    "\n",
    "raster dataset using the points that are spatially located within that cell. To\n",
    "\n",
    "do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A grid is placed on top of the LiDAR data in geographic space. Each cell in\n",
    "\n",
    "the grid has the same spatial dimensions. These dimensions represent that\n",
    "\n",
    "particular area on the ground. If we want to derive a 1 m resolution raster\n",
    "\n",
    "from the lidar data, we overlay a 1m by 1m grid over the LiDAR data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within each 1 m x 1 m cell, we calculate a value to be applied to that cell,\n",
    "\n",
    "using the LiDAR points found within that cell. The simplest method of doing this\n",
    "\n",
    "is to take the max, min or mean height value of all lidar points found within\n",
    "\n",
    "the 1 m cell. If we use this approach, we might have cells in the raster that\n",
    "\n",
    "don't contains any lidar points. These cells will have a \"no data\" value if we\n",
    "\n",
    "process our raster in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point to Raster Methods - Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A different approach is to interpolate the value for each cell. Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "considers the values of points outside of the cell in addition to points within\n",
    "\n",
    "the cell to calculate a value. Interpolation also often uses statistical operations\n",
    "\n",
    "(math) to calculate the cell value. Interpolation is useful because it can provide us\n",
    "\n",
    "with some ability to predict or calculate cell values in areas where there are\n",
    "\n",
    "no data (or no points). And to quantify the error associated with those predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "which is useful to know, if you are doing research.\n",
