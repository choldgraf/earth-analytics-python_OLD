    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep object names short:** this makes them easier to read when scanning through code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use meaningful names:** For example: `precip` is a more useful name that tells us something about the object compared to `x`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Don't start names with numbers!** Objects that start with a number are NOT VALID in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid names that are existing functions in R:** e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "`if`, `else`, `for`, see\n",
    "\n",
    "[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other notes about object names in `R`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `R` is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid using dots in object names - e.g. `my.dataset` - dots have a special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages. Instead use underscores `my_dataset`.\n",
